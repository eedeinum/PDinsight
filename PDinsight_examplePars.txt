## Parameter file belonging to PDinsight.py
## This script computes the requirements for obtaining a given target effective wall permeability (Peff) through diffusive symplastic transport and/or values of Peff given all parameters. 
## All output is written to files, tsv (tab separated values) format, with names indicated with the respective modes/switches.
## The first (or sometimes second/..) line of each output file contains the column headers. 
## This script belongs to the manuscript .... Deinum et al 2019, ... . When using this script, please cite Deinum et al 2019. 
## In this script, PDs are modeled as a set of concentric cylinders. The space available for symplastic transport, the cytoplasmic sleeve, is confined between desmotubule (DT, radius Rdt) and outer radius (Rn, neck radius and/or Rc, central radius). 
### If Rn == Rc, as is the case in most computations in this script, the parameter Lneck (length of the neck region) does not have any effect.
### We found that Fih, a correction factor for the fact that the cell wall is only permeable at discrete spots (the PDs), does not depend on Lcell, the cell length. This parameter, therefore, also has no effect.

## Script usage: python PDinsight.py [PARFILE]
## where PARFILE is the name of the parameter file. If no name is given, the script looks for "parameters.txt" in the current directory.
## Alternatively (linux), make the script executable and type ./PDinsight.py [PARFILE]
## After reading, all parameters are printed to "allParameters.txt"

## switches for computing. Choose between 1 ("True") and 0 ("False").
compSubNano 0 # switch: compare with sub-nano channel model; conversion factors are written to file "densityConversionFactorTable.dat"; these are only valid for sufficiently narrow channels. 
computeClusterIncrease 0 # switch: consider (repeated) twinning from the starting densities in densList rather than homogeneous (high) densities. Useful for computing requirements for a sudden increase of Peff. ; only affects computeAperture and computeVals
doNotCombine 1 # switch: affects computeUnitVals and computeVals. Instead of looping over all combinations, equal length lists (or single values) of the applicable variables are required, and values are computed per i-th set of parameters.
asymmetricPDs 1  # Allow for different Lneck and Rn on either side of the PD. Required inputs: Rn1List, Rn2List, Lneck1List,Lneck2List (all equal length). Currenly only works for computeVals and computeUnitVals with doNotCombine==True


# Modes for computing tables
computeDens 0 # switch: calculate required densities for Peff targets in peList and alpha_bar values in xMaxList ; output is written to file "requiredDensityTable.dat"
computeAperture 0 ## calculate required alpha_bar and Rn values for Peff targets in peList and densities in densList; if computeClusterIncrease == True: calculate required alpha_bar and Rn values for Peff targets in peList, starting densities in densList and the n-fold increase in clusters from twinningList ; output is written to file "requiredApertureTable.dat"
computeVals 1 # calculate Peff values from all given combinations of variable parameters: densList x xMaxList [[ x RcList]] x ....
computeUnitVals 1 # calculate unit permeability (Punit) values: for a density of 1 PD/um2, not considering inhomogeneity factor Fih. Calculate Punit from all given combinations of variable parameters: RnList x RdtList x LpdList [x RcList (insofar Rn <= Rc)] ; currently incompatible with compSubNano
sensitivityAnalysis 0 # numerically compute normalized partial derivatives of Peff and other quantities (to alpha=x, Rn, Rc, Rdt, Lpd, Lneck, Rho=dens ) around a starting point 

# Modes for computing graphs (high resolution tables that can be plotted with a graphics program of choice)
computeRnDensityGraph 0 # switch: compute Rn, rho graphs that yield target Peff in peList. Rn is increased by steps of xStep; Rn runs from Rdt+xStart to Rdt + xMax; incompatible with compSubNano, because correction factors can't be used for large Rn

# Modes for computing tables with inhomogeneity correction factor Fih
computeFih_subNano 0 # switch: compute Fih values for default and sub-nano channel model; results are written to files "Fih_subNano_densXX_lXX.dat", where XX are the respective parameter values.
computeFih_pitField_xMax 0 # switch: compute Fih for pit fields as a function of maximum particle radius (xMax / alpha_bar) ; results are written to files Fih_xMax_pit_RnXX_dXX_lXX.dat", where XX are the respective parameter values.
computeFih_pitField_dens 0 # switch: compute Fih for pit fields as a function of PD density (rho); results are written to files Fih_dens_pit_RnXX_dXX_lXX.dat", where XX are the respective parameter values.  
# Related to Fih: compute tables with impact of (repeated) twinning on total Peff
computeTwinning 0 # switch: compute impact on Peff due to twinning, starting from isolated PDs that follow the distribution of parameter grid.; results are written to files "twinning_pit_RnXX_dXX_lXX.dat", where XX are the respective parameter values.
